## Project Overview

*Nerede Yeşek?* is a **full-stack Web GIS application** developed as the final project for the GMT 458 Web GIS course.  
The application allows users to discover restaurants on an interactive map, add new locations, and interact with the system through basic gamification features.

The main focus of the project is on **Web GIS concepts**, **spatial databases**, and **client–server architecture**.
